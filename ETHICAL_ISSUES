ETHICAL ISSUES:

1. Privacy and Data Security

User Data Protection: Collecting personal information (e.g., user profiles, and location) requires strong security measures to prevent data breaches.
Third-Party Access: If data is shared with charities or partners, clear consent policies must be in place.
Chat Safety: Ensuring secure and encrypted communication prevents data interception or misuse.


2. Trust and Safety

Scams and Fraud: Users might misuse the platform to deceive others (e.g., listing fake items or not delivering promised items).
Content Moderation: Ensuring item listings are appropriate and do not contain offensive or misleading content.
User Behavior Monitoring: Implementing reporting and review mechanisms to handle disputes and prevent harassment.


3. Environmental and Ethical Sustainability

Greenwashing Risks: The platform should ensure transparency in its sustainability claims and avoid misleading users about its impact.
Shipping and Carbon Footprint: Encouraging local exchanges to minimize the environmental impact of transportation.


4. Digital Accessibility and Inclusion

Usability for All Users: Ensuring the platform is accessible to individuals with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility, colour contrast).
Socioeconomic Barriers: Ensuring fair access for all users, regardless of their technological literacy or internet access.


5. Legal and Regulatory Compliance

Terms of Service and Liability: Clearly defining the platformâ€™s responsibility in case of disputes or fraudulent activities.
Tax and Donation Regulations: Compliance with local laws is essential if donations have financial or tax implications.
Consumer Protection Laws: Ensuring the platform follows e-commerce and digital marketplace regulations.

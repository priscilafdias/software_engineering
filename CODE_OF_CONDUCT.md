Maintainers and community members are encouraged to address violations as soon as they are identified and to do so in a manner that prioritizes respectful dialogue and resolution.


# Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
 Unacceptable behavior may result in actions such as:
-	A request to cease the inappropriate behavior.
-	Removal of offending content or code.
-	Temporary suspension of access to community spaces (chat, forums, etc.)
-	Permanent ban from contributing to the project or participating in the community.

# Professional Conduct and Team Collaboration
Working in a team can sometimes lead to imbalances in project development. To ensure smooth collaboration, each team member should:
-	Communicate openly about project goals and responsibilities.
-	Respect deadlines and commitments while being mindful of personal and 
  professional constraints.
-	Address conflicts professionally and seek resolution through discussion and 
 mediation.
-	Give credit where it is due and acknowledge the work of all contributors.
-	Ensure that all decisions affecting the project are made with fairness, 
 inclusivity, and collective input.
 
# Accountability and Responsibilities
All contributors and team members are expected to fulfill their roles and complete assigned tasks within the agreed-upon timelines. If challenges arise, open communication is encouraged to seek support or request adjustments.
Consequences for Repeated Failure to Fulfill Responsibilities:
-	First Occurrence: A friendly check-in to understand challenges and offer support.
-	Second Occurrence: A discussion with project leads or team members to reassess 
 workload, deadlines, or responsibilities.
-	Third Occurrence: A formal warning and potential reassignment of tasks.
-	Ongoing Negligence: Temporary or permanent removal from the project, depending on the severity of the issue.

All actions will be taken with fairness and transparency, with an emphasis on problem-solving rather than punishment. The goal is to ensure smooth collaboration while respecting everyone's contributions and commitments.

By participating in our project, everyone agrees to follow this Code of Conduct. We value your participation and strive to maintain an inclusive, friendly, and respectful environment for all. Thank you for contributing to our community!
